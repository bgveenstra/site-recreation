# Site Recreation Training

## Introduction

One of the best ways to sharpen your CSS skills is to try to recreate an existing style and layout, so take a look at the deliverable below, work alone or with a partner, and build your own version of this Instagram.com homepage.  Don't worry if you can't get it to look _exactly_ as you see, but try to get as close as possible.

There's a bit of starter code, so you can jump right into it.

## Training

#### Base Requirements

- Use display, clear, and floats to position elements on the page.
- Look up and use CSS properties and values that may not have been covered in class, for example:
  - `background: url("YOUR-LINK.COM")`
  - `list-style`
  - `text-decoration`
  - `text-transform`
- Use a single external CSS stylesheet to style all pages.
- Use the images provided to construct the appropriate elements on the page:
  - the iPhone
  - App Store and Google Play buttons
  - Instagram Logo
  - Login button

**Bonus:**
- Make it even better than Instagram! Throw in some animations, experiment with `hover`, make it fun.

#### Starter Code

The starter code contains all the html and css files, images, and text content needed to create the page. The text is in the `index.html`, and the color palette is in `main.css`.

#### Deliverable

Please take a screenshot of your results and share them in Slack! They should look something like this:

#### Extra Time?

If your Instagram clone is awesome and you have extra time, consider trying to recreate the layout of one of the sites below (starer code and images not provided):
